### Clarifications
- [**(Technological) singularity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity)
  
  During the lecture we used the term _singularity_ and explained it briefly. 
  Afterwards we concluded it may be a bit to cursory for some students.
  Read the section below and take a look at the Wikipedia page.
  
  From [Oxford Dictionaries](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/singularity):
  > A hypothetical moment in time when artificial intelligence and 
  > other technologies have become so advanced that humanity undergoes 
  > a dramatic and irreversible change.
  
  The Wikipedia article gives the reader a deeper understanding of this concept.
  It's not a requirement to read it completely. **You only need to understand the term _singularity_ 
  and, as part of 2. Ethical Aspects, its possible effects on human civilization.**


### Extra
- [**Boston Dynamics on YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/user/BostonDynamics)

  From the [Wikipedia article on Boston Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Dynamics): 
  > Boston Dynamics is an American engineering and robotics design company founded in 1992 as a spin-off
  > from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, 
  > Boston Dynamics is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group.

  [Boston Dynamics](https://www.bostondynamics.com/about) publishes some its advances on YouTube. It's very interesting and recommended to watch the progress they have made throughout the last years.
  
- [**Robotic Systems Lab at ETH Zurich**](http://www.rsl.ethz.ch)

  The RSL from ETH in Zurich is, from a research perspective, even more impressive than Boston Dynamics.
  They are also on YouTube as user [leggedrobotics](https://www.youtube.com/user/leggedrobotics).
  

## 2. Ethical Aspects

The junior-colleague

* can describe 10 ethical aspects of AI in own words.

## 3. Introduction to Python: Part One
### Goals
The junior-colleague

* can write fluent Python code.

### How to achieve the goal

This goal can't be achieved overnight!
There is only one way to learn a programming language: **used it!**
Unfortunately there is no shortcut for hard work. If there was one, we would share it with you!

The assignments are embedded in the slides of Part Two. But you are allowed to create something else...
Just program a small but super interesting project in Python (text based). Set fire to your own passion and burn like a good bonfire! **If you get stuck, have a question: never hesitate to reach out to us!**
